Cytochrome c oxidase or complex IV, catalyzes the final step in mitochondrial electron transfer chain, and is regarded as one of the major regulation sites for oxidative phosphorylation. This enzyme is controlled by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Among its 13 subunits, three are encoded by mitochondrial DNA and ten by nuclear DNA. In this work, an RNA interference approach was taken which led to the generation of mouse A9 cell derivatives with suppressed expression of nuclear-encoded subunit IV (COX IV) of this complex. The amounts of this subunit are decrease by 86% to 94% of normal level. A detail biosynthetic and functional analysis of several cell lines with suppressed COX IV expression revealed a loss of assembly of cytochrome c oxidase complex and, correspondingly, a reduction in cytochrome c oxidase-dependent respiration and total respiration. Furthermore, dysfunctional cytochrome c oxidase in the cells leads to a compromised mitochondrial membrane potential, a decreased ATP level, and failure to grow in galactose medium. Interestingly, suppression of COX IV expression also sensitizes the cells to apoptosis. These observations provide the evidence of the essential role of the COX IV subunit for a functional cytochrome c oxidase complex and also demonstrate a tight control of cytochrome c oxidase over oxidative phosphorylation. Finally, our results further shed some insights into the pathogenic mechanism of the diseases caused by dysfunctional cytochrome c oxidase complex.

Introduction

Mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal complex (complex IV) of the electron transfer chain. It catalyzes the transfer of electrons from ferrocytochrome c to molecular oxygen, converting the latter to water. The protein complex has 13 different subunits with a total molecular weight of 204,000 daltons. The enzyme is active as a dimer. The three biggest subunits, COX I, II and III, encoded by the mitochondrial genome, form the functional core of the enzyme complex [1]. The rest of ten subunits and more than two dozen identified cytochrome c oxidase-specific regulatory genes are all encoded by nuclear genes [2]. However, the function of each subunit, particularly those encoded by the nuclear genome, and the molecular mechanism of the regulation on the activity of this important protein complex are largely unknown.

Cytochrome c oxidase complex has also been suggested as a major regulation site for oxidative phosphorylation [3]. Despite the seemingly large excess of both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and its transcription activity [4], a relative low reserve of cytochrome c oxidase capacity has been reported in a variety of mammalian cell types [5].

Deficiency in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase has been associated with a wide range of human disorders, and is one of the most frequent causes of mitochondrial defects [2]. The clinical phenotypes include stroke, cardioencephalomyopathy, hepatic failure and Leigh’s syndrome [6]. Most of the mutations described so far were heteroplasmic forms in mtDNA encoded subunits and nuclear-encoded cytochrome c oxidase complex assembly factors. Surprisingly mutations in nuclear-encoded subunits have not reported in association with mitochondrial disorders [6].

In the present work, we generated several cell lines with decreased expression of subunits 4 of cytochrome c oxidase complex (COX IV). Blue-native gel analysis on respiratory complexes, determination on respiration and mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as ATP level have shown COX IV is essential for the assembly and function of cytochrome c oxidase complex, probably at the threshold of around 40% of COX IV protein synthesis. Our results also further indicate that cytochrome c oxidase complex exerts a tight control on mitochondrial function.

Cell lines and media

All the cell lines used in the present work were grown in monolayer culture. The cell line A9 (ATCC CCL-1.4) is a derivative of the L mouse fibroblast cell line [7]. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
